# NYC-Taxi-Trips

This is an data analysis project of NYC taxi trips from 2009 to 2012. Here you have instructions to reproduce the results.

## Getting the data

To reproduce the results, first of all you have to get the dataset and create a folder named "data" in the principal folder (NYC-Taxi-Trips). The links to the datasets can be found below.

## Dependencies

The analysis was made using some python libraries. Install the dependencies from "requirements.txt" to get the correct versions.

*Tip: You can create an virtual-env to not lose your actual versions, it could your other projects. You can see more about virtual-envs [here](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/)*

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
